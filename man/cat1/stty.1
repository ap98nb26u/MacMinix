Command:        stty - set the terminal parameters
Syntax:         stty [option ...]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       stty -echo              # Suppress echoing of input
                stty erase #            # Set the erase character to #
                stty </dev/tt1          # Print terminal tty1 parameters

     When given no arguments, stty prints the current terminal parameters.  It 
can also be used to set the parameters, as follows:
                cbreak          enter cbreak mode, erase and kill disabled
                echo            echo input on the terminal
                nl              accept only line feed to end lines
                raw             enter raw mode, no input processing at all
                tabs            output tabs (do not expand to spaces)
                erase c         set erase character (initially backspace)
                int c           set interrupt (SIGINT) char. (initially DEL)
                kill c          set kill line character (initially @)
                quit c          set quit (SIGQUIT) character (initially CTRL-\)
                default         set options back to original values
                even            set even parity
                odd             set odd parity
                [5-8]           set bits per word
                [110-9600]      set baud rate

     The first five options may be prefixed by - as in -tabs to turn the 
option off.  The next four options each have a single character parameter 
separated by a space from the option.  The default option sets the mode and 
the four settable characters back to the values they had when the system was  
booted.  It is useful when a rogue program has messed them up.
