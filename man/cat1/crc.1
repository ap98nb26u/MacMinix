Command:        crc - print the checksum of a file
Syntax:         crc
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       crc *.c                 # print checksums of all C programs

     The checksum of each argument is computed and printed, along with the 
file length and its name, one file per line.  This program is useful for
seeing if a file transmitted to another machine has arrived correctly.  It is 
conceptually similar to sum, except that it uses a strong checksum algorithm 
and also prints the length.  The filename '-' may be used for standard input.
