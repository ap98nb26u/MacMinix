Command:        modem - put a modem into dial-in or dial-out mode
Syntax:         modem [-d] [-g] [-o] [-i rings] line
Flags:          -d      use debug mode
                -g      set permanent dial-in mode (turn uugetty into getty)
                -o      set dial out mode
                -i n    set dial-in mode, and wait n rings before answering
Example:        modem -i6 tty1         # Make tty1 dialin (6 rings)

     Modem allows the same line to be used for dial-in and dial-out..  The -o
flag suspends any getty process associated with the line, and set up the
(Hayes) modem for dialout.  The -i flag restarts a suspended getty, and sets
the modem to answer the phone after the given number of rings.  

     Modem returns the following exit codes: 
        1    ok
        0    error, getty would not listen
       -1    error in utmp file
       -2    tty not found
       -3    process not getty
       -4    process busy
       -5    unknown process type
