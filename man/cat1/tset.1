Command:        tset - set the $TERM variable
Syntax:         tset [device]
Flags:          (none)
Example:        eval `tset`             # In .profile, logs into any terminal
                eval `tset dev_typ`     # Change $TERM during a session

     Tset is used almost exclusively to set the shell variable TERM from 
inside .profile files.  If an argument is supplied it is used as the value
of TERM.  Otherwise tset looks in /etc/ttytype for the value associated with
the current port.

     Files used: /etc/ttytype
