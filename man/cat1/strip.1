Command:        strip - remove a symbol table from an executable file
Syntax:         strip [file] ...
Flags:          (none)
Example:        strip foo               # Remove symbols from foo

     For each file argument, strip removes the symbol table.  Strip makes a 
copy of the file being stripped, so links are lost.  When no file is present,
a.out is assumed.
