Command:        readall - read a device quickly to check for bad blocks
Syntax:         readall file [-b] [-t]
Flags:          -b      Output a shell script to mark all badblocks found
                -t      Report the total number of blocks found
Example:        readall /dev/hd0                # Read all of /dev/hd0
                readall -t /dev/ram             # Print the ramdisk size

     Readall reads all of the named device in large chunks.  It reports about 
blocks that it cannot read.  Unlike diskcheck, it does not attempt to write on 
the disk, making it safer to use when one is worried about a sick system.
