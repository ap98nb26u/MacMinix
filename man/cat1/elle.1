     Elle is a screen-oriented editor that is patterned after Emacs.  It can 
edit multiple files regardless of their length, can support 1 or 2 windows, and
has many other powerful features.  A user-profile .ellepro.b1 can be placed in
$HOME to give elle much the same key-bindings as mined.  There is also a help
file, elle.help, in /usr/lib.  The program is described in doc/elle.doc.
