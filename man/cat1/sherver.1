Command:        sherver - shell server
Syntax:         sherver port
Flags:          (none)
Example:        sherver m1              # Start a sherver listening to port m1

     The rsh command does its remote execution by doing a remote procedure 
call to some sherver.  The sherver executes the command and then exits.  
Usually a master will be running to start a new sherver.  Because shervers get 
their input from a pipe, remote execution cannot handle signals and CTRL-D, 
because they cannot be sent down a pipe.
