Command:        look - look up words in a dictionary
Syntax:         look [-f] prefix[/suffix] [dictionary] 
Flags:          -f      fold upper case letters to lower case
Examples:       look ard                # Print words starting with ard
                look /bing              # Print words ending in bing
                look -f f/ar            # Words starting with f, ending in ar

     Look takes a prefix and/or suffix and searches /usr/lib/dictionary or the 
specified dictionary for all words that match, which it then prints. The -f
flag causes all upper case letters to be treated as lower case.  This program
differs slightly from the UNIX look(1).

     Files used: /usr/lib/dictionary
