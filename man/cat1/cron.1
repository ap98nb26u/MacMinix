     Cron is a clock daemon.  It is typically started up by including the 
command /usr/bin/cron in the /etc/rc file.  Once started, cron puts itself in 
the background, so no & is needed.  It runs forever, sleeping most of the 
time.  Once a minute it wakes up and examines /usr/lib/crontab to see if there 
is any work to do.  If there is, the work is done.  The entries of 
/usr/lib/crontab contain 6 elements each; minute, hour, day-of-month, month,
day-of-week, command.  Some examples follow:

   min hr dat mo day   command
    *  *   *  *   *    /usr/bin/date >/dev/tty0   # Print date every minute
    0  *   *  *   *    /usr/bin/date >/dev/tty0   # Print date on the hour
   30  4   *  *  1-5   /bin/backup /dev/fd1       # Do backup Mon-Fri at 0430
   30 19   *  *  1,3,5 /etc/backup /dev/fd1       # Mon, Wed, Fri at 1930
    0  9  25 12   *    /usr/bin/sing >/dev/tty0   # Xmas morning at 0900 only

     Comments are allowed in crontab, and cron logs its actions to
/usr/adm/cronlog if this file exists.
