Command:        basename - strip off file prefixes and suffixes
Syntax:         basename file [suffix]
Flags:          (none)
Examples: basename /user/ast/file       # Strips path to yield file
          basename /user/file.c .c      # Strips path and .c to yield file

     The initial directory names (if any) are removed yielding the name of the 
file itself.  If a second argument is present, it is interpreted as a suffix  
and is also stripped, if present.  This program is primarily used in shell 
scripts.
