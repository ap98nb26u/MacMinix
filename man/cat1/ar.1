Command:        ar - archiver
Syntax:         ar [dmpqrtx][abciluv] [posname] archive file ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       ar r libc.a sort.s      # Replace sort.s in libc.a
                ar rb a.s libc.a b.s    # Insert b.s before a.s in libc.a

     Ar allows groups of files to be put together into a single archive.  It 
is normally used for libraries of compiled procedures.  The following keys are 
allowed: 
        d: delete.  Ar will delete the name members.
        m: move named files.  Ar expects 'a', 'b', or 'i' to be specified.
        p: print the named files (list them on standard output)
        q: quickly append to the end of the archive file.
        r: replace (append when not in archive).
        t: print the archive's table of contents.
        x: extract

The keys may optionally concatencated with one or more of the following:
        a: after 'posname'
        b: before 'posname'
        c: create (suppresses creation message)
        i: before 'posname'
        l: local temporary file for work instead of /tmp/ar.$$$$$
        u: replace only if dated later than member in archive
        v: verbose

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
