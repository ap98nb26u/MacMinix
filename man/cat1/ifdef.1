Command:        ifdef - remove unwanted ifdefs from C code
Syntax:         ifdef [-t] [-Dsymb] [-dsymb] [-Usymb] [-Isymb] [file]
Flags:          -t     # display a table of defined and undefined symbols
                -D     # symbol can change from defined <-> undefined)
                -d     # symbol cannot change from defined <-> undefined)
                -U     # undefine the symbol
                -I     # ignore the symbol
Example:        ifdef -t ifdef.c        # show the defines in ifdef.c

     Ifdef strips unwanted #defines from C code, making it easier to read,
understand, and possibly compile.
