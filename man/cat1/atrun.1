Command:        atrun - run commands for 'at'
Syntax:         (none)
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       (none)

     The program atrun should be started periodically, for example, every
minute by cron, to run commands prepared by at.  Atrun checks to see if any 
files in /usr/spool/at should now be run, and if so, it runs them and then 
puts them in /usr/spool/at/past.  See the description of 'at'.

     Files used: /usr/spool/at/YY.DDD.HHMM.UU
                 /usr/spool/at/past/YY.DDD.HHMM.UU
