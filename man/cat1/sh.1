     Sh is the shell, which forms the user's main interface with the system.
On startup, the shell reads /etc/profile and $HOME/.profile, if they exist,
and executes any commands they contain.  The Minix shell has most of the
features of the V7 (Bourne) shell, including redirection of input and output,
pipes, magic characters, background processes, and shell scripts.  A few of
the more common commands are listed below:

date                    # Regular command
sort <file              # Redirect input
sort <file1 >file2      # Redirect input and output
cc file.c 2>error       # Redirect standard error
a.out >f 2>&1           # Combine standard output and standard error
sort <file1 >>file2     # Append output to file2
sort <file1 >file2 &    # Background job
(ls -l; a.out) &        # Run two background commands sequentially
sort <file | wc         # Two-process pipeline
sort <f | uniq | wc     # Three-process pipeline
ls -l *.c               # List all files ending in .c
ls -l [a-c]*            # List all files beginning with a, b or c
ls -l ?                 # List all one-character file names
ls \?                   # List the file whose name is a question mark
ls '???'                # List the file whose name is three question marks
v=/usr/ast              # Set shell variable v
ls -l $v                # Use shell variable v
PS1='Hi!'               # Change the primary prompt to Hi!
PS2='More:'             # Change the secondary prompt to More:

echo $$                 # Echo shell's pid
echo $#                 # Echo number of parameters (shell script)
