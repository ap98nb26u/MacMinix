     File reads the first block of a file and tries to make an intelligent 
guess about what kind of file it is.  It understands about directories,
block and character special files, archives, object files, executable
binaries, shell scripts, C programs, English text, and ASCII text.  Any file
it can't recognise it calls 'data'.
