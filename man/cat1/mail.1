     Mail is an extremely simple electronic mail program.  It can be used to
send or receive email on a single MINIX system, in which case it functions as
user agent and local delivery agent.  If the MAILER is defined in mail.c, it
can also call a transport agent to handle remote mail as well.
     When called by user with no arguments, it examines the mailbox
/usr/spool/mail/user, prints one message (depending on the -r flag), and waits
for one of the following commands:
        <newline>       go to the next message
        -               print the previous message
        !command        fork off a shell and execute command
        CTRL-D          update the mailbox and quit (same as q)
        d               delete the current message and go to the next one
        q               update the mailbox and quit (same as CTRL-D)
        p               print the current message again
        s[file]         save message in the named file
        x               exit without updating the mailbox

    To send mail, the program is called with the name of the recipient as
argument.  The mail is sent, along with a postmark line containing the date.
For local delivery, a file named after the recipient in the directory
/usr/spool/mail must be writable.

    Files used: /usr/spool/mail/username
                /usr/spool/mail/username.lock
                /usr/lib/mail.help
