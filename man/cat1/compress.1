Command:        compress - compress a file using modified Lempel-Ziv coding
Syntax:         compress [flags] [-b #] [file] ...
Flags:          -C      generate output compatible with compress 2.0
                -V      give version number and compression statistics 
                -b #    limit the maximum number of bits/code to #
                -c      put output on standard output instead of on file.Z
                -d      decompress instead of compress
                -f      force compressed output even if there is space saved
                -q      quiet mode
                -n      ignore header information (to decompress old files)
                -v      give compression statistics
Examples:       compress <infile >outfile       # Compress 1 file
                compress x y z  # Compress 3 files to x.Z, y.Z, and z.Z

     The listed files (or standard input, if none are given) are compressed
using the Ziv-Lempel algorithm.  If the output is smaller than the input,
the output is put on file.Z or standard output if no files are listed.  If
compress is linked to 'uncompress', the latter is the same as "compress -d".
Similarly, a link to 'zcat' decompresses to standard output by default.
