Command:        co - check out an SVC revision
Syntax:         co [-l] [-r #] file
Flags:          -l      place a lock on the SVC archive after checkout
                -r #    check out revision # instead most recent revision
Examples:       co -l Makefile          # Check out and lock Makefile
                co -r 4 foo             # Check out version 4 of foo

     Co checks the specified file out of its SVC archive.  If the archive
".../file,S" does not exist, it is searched for in ".../SVC/file,S".
     The specified revision will be checked out and placed in "file"; by
default it will be non-writable.  If "-l" is specified, a lock will be
placed on the archive and the file will be writable.
