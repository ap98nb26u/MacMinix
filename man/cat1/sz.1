                -l #    flow control every # packets
                -n      overwrite destination if source is newer
                -o      use old (16-bit) checksum
                -p      protect file if it already exists
                -q      quiet mode, overrides verbose
                -r      resume interrupted file transfer
                -t #    set timeout in tenths of a second
                -u      unlink file after successful transmission
                -v      verbose, more 'v's more info.

Examples:       sz file </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1# Send file

     Sz is a program that accepts a file sent from another computer using the
zmodem protocol.  It is a highly complex program, which if called as sb or sx,
operates in YMODEM (batch) or XMODEM mode.  See the description of rz, and the
doc/sz.doc and doc/rz.doc files, for more information.
