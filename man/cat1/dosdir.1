     Dosdir reads standard IBM PC diskettes or hard disk partitions in MS-DOS 
format, and lists their contents on standard output.  Directory names should 
contain slashes to separate components, even though MS-DOS uses backslashes.  
The names dosdir, dosread, and doswrite are all links to the same program.  
The program sees which function to perform by seeing how it was called.  The 
program uses device files named dosX, where X is A, B, C, etc. which must be
linked to the appropriate standard device file.

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
