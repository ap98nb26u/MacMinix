Command:        from - input half of a connection
Syntax:         from port
Flags:          (none)

     To and from are used together to provide connection-oriented service.  On 
the sending machine, the last member of a pipeline is 'to port'.  On the 
receiving machine, the first member of a pipe line is 'from port'.  The net 
result is that the output of the sending pipeline goes into the input of the 
receiving pipeline, making pipelines work across the network.
