     De is a program for system administrators that allows disks to be
inspected block by block.  A variety of display options and commands are
available; for a summary, start the program and type h for help.  The program
can also restore files that have just been removed by rm, provided that the
i-node and blocks are still intact.  Another feature is searching disks for
ASCII strings, to help locate files after a crash.  Finally, individual disk
words can be changed, for example, the sizes of block special files.  The
program is described in doc/de.doc.
