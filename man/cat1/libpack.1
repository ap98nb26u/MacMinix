     This program is a filter that reads an ASCII assembly code file from 
standard input and writes the corresponding packed file on standard output.  
The compiler libraries are archives of packed assembly code files, in which
common assembly code strings are replaced by single-byte abbreviations.  All
abbreviations have their high bit set.

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
