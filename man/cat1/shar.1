Command:        shar - shell archiver
Syntax:         shar file ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       shar *.c >prog.sh       # Collect C programs in shell archive
                sh <prog.sh             # Extract files from a shell archive

     The named files are collected together into a shell archive written onto 
standard output.  The individual files can be extracted by redirecting the 
shell archive into the shell.  The advantage of shar over ar is that shar 
archives can be read on almost any UNIX system, whereas numerous, incompatible 
versions of ar are in widespread use.  Extracting the files from a shell 
archive requires that gres is accessible.  In the distribution, gres is in 
/user/bin rather than /usr/bin.
