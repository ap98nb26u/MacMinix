Command:        master - control the creation of shervers
Syntax:         master count uid gid command
Flags:          (none)
Example:        master 2 1 1 /usr/bin/sherver port # Start two shervers

     If a machine is intended to be used as a server, its /etc/rc file should 
have a command similar to the example above.  When the system is booted, 
master runs and forks off the required number of shervers (shell servers), up 
to a maximum of four.  They run with the indicated uid and gid, and listen to 
the indicated port.  When an rsh is done on a client machine, the command is 
given to one of the shervers for execution.  When the sherver is done it exits,
and the master, which is always running, sees this and creates a new sherver.  
Thus master is very similar to init, only it makes new shervers (usually) 
instead of new login programs.  Master must run as root to be able to do  
setuid and setgid.
