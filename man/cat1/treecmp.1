Command:        treecmp - recursively list differences in two directory trees
Syntax:         treecmp [-cv] dir1 dir2
Flags:          -c      list the names of changed and new files only
                -v      list all directories processed (verbose)
Example:        treecmp -v /usr/ast/V1 /usr/ast/V2      # Compare two trees

     Treecmp recursively descends the directory tree of the second argument
and compares all files to those at the corresponding position in the first
argument.  If the two trees are identical, i.e., all the corresponding 
directories and files are the same, there is no output.  Otherwise, a list of 
files missing from one of the trees or present in both but whose contents are 
not identical in both are printed.
