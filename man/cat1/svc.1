     SVC is the Shell Version Control system, patterned on RCS.  It maintains
a sequence of versions in archive files, so that new versions can be checked
in (added to the archive), and old versions can be checked out (made
available).  To create an archive for file, check it in with the -u flag.
This action will prompt for a log message and then create an archive called
file,S in the current directory, or in the subdirectory SVC if it exists.  The
file will not be deleted, but will be made unwritable.  Depending on how they
are compiled, ci and co rely on either fix or patch to do the actual work of
updating files.
     To update a file, check it out with the -l flag.  Then modify it, and
check it back in, giving a new message when prompted.  After this process has
been repeated many times, the archive will contain the entire history.  Any
version can be checked out using the -r flag.  To get a printout of the
history, use svclog.
