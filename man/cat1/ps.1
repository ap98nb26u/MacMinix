Command:        ps - report the process status
Syntax:         ps [-] [alxU] [kernel mm fs]
                -a      print information on all processes except those not
                        associated with a terminal
                -l      print a long format report
                -x      print information on processes not associated with
                        a terminal 
                -U      Create the ps database file 
Example:        ps -ax          # report on processes within the kernel
                ps -l           # long report on the current process group 

     Ps is very similar to the V7 version, but cannot read memory from a core
file.  It requires a database file /etc/psdatbase, or the inclusion of symbol
tables when building in the kernel, mm, and fs.  Fields changed from V7 are
CPU, NICE, and PRI which are missing, RECV which replaces WCHAN, and RUID
and PGRP which are extras.

     Fields displayed with the -l option are: 
        F        process flags @@@ 
        S        process state (Zombie, Waiting, Sleeping, Runnable, Trace) 
        UID      UID of process owner
        PID      PID of process
        PPID     PID of parent process
        PGRP     process group
        ADDR     memory address of the process 
        SZ       size in blocks of the core image
        RECV     process from which messages will be accepted
        TTY      controlling tty
        TIME     cumulative (user + sys) time used by the process
        CMD      command used to start the process

     Files used: /etc/psdatabase
