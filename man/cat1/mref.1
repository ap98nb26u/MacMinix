Command:        mref - make a listing and cross-reference map of MINIX
                mref [-#] [dlmtsx] [p page] file ...
Flags:          -#      print # lines per page (default 50)
                -d      do not produce definition file (symbol table)
                -l      do not produce listing
                -m      multiple references on one line are listed only once
                -p #    set initial page number to #
                -t      generate troff macro call before each page
                -s      suppress line numbering between procedures
                -x      do not produce cross-reference map
Examples:       mref *.[ch]             # List and cross reference files
                mref -60 -t *.c         # Produce troff input at 60 lines/page
                mref -dx -p 100 *.c     # Listing only, first page number 100

     In default mode, mref produces three output files: a numbered listing of
the input files (on standard output), a global symbol table (on symbol.out),
and a cross reference map to the global symbols (on xref.out).  A global
symbol in this context is one present in a #define, PUBLIC, PRIVATE, or SYMBOL
statement (the latter being introduced to allow users to explicitly declare
certain symbols as global). Any of the three outputs can be suppressed, or
alternatively, be made suitable for input to troff for typesetting.
