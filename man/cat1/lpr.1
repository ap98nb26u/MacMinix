Command:        lpr - copy a file to the line printer
Syntax:         lpr [file] ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       lpr file &              # Print file on the line printer
                pr file | lpr &         # Print standard input (pr's output)

     Each argument is interpreted as a file to be printed.  Lpr copies each 
file to /dev/lp, without spooling.  It inserts carriage returns and expands 
tabs.  Only one lpr at a time may be running.
