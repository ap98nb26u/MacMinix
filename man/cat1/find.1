Command:        find - find files meeting a given condition
Syntax:         find directory expression
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       find /  -name a.out -print      # Print all a.out paths
                find /usr/ast ! -newer f -ok rm {} \;   # Ask before removing
                find /usr -size +20 -exec mv {} /big \; # Move files > 20 blks
                find / \( -name a.out -o -name `*.o` \) -exec rm {}\; # two
                                                                # conditions

     Find descends the file tree starting at the given directory checking each 
file in that directory and its subdirectories against a predicate.  If the 
predicate is true, an action is taken.  The predicates may be connected by -a 
(Boolean and), -o (Boolean or) and ! (Boolean negation).  Each predicate is 
true under the conditions specified below.  The integer n may also be +n to 
mean any value greater than n, -n to mean any value less than n, or just n for 
exactly n.
  -name s       true if current filename is s (include shell wild cards)
  -perm n       true if the file's permission bits = n (n is in octal)
  -type x       where x is bcdfug (block, char, dir, regular, setuid, setgid)
  -links n      true if the number of links to the file is n
  -user u       true if the uid = u (a numerical value, not a login name)
  -group g      true if the gid = g (a numerical value, not a group name)
  -size n       true if file size is n blocks
  -inum n       true if the current file's i-node number is n
  -atime n      true if access time... not implemented under MINIX
  -mtime n      true if modification time relative to today (in days) is n
  -newer f      true if the file is newer than f
  -xdev         do not cross devices to search mounted file systems.
The expression can be followed by one of the actions listed below, to say what
must be done when a file is found:
  -print        print the file name on standard output
  -exec         execute a MINIX command, {} stands for the file name
  -ok           prompts before executing the command
