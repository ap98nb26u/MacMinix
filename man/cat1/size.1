Command:        size - print the text, data, and bss sizes of a program
Syntax:         size [file] ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       size                    # Print the sizes of a.out
                size filename           # Print the sizes of filename

     The text, data, bss, and total sizes for each argument are printed.  If 
no arguments are present, a.out is assumed.  The amount of memory available 
for combined stack and data segment growth is printed in the column 'stack.' 
This is the value manipulated by the chmem command.  The total amount of 
memory allocated to the program when it is loaded is listed under 'memory.' 
This value is just the sum of the other four columns.
