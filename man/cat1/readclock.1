Command:        readclock - read the AT's real time clock
Syntax:         readclock
Flags:          (none)
Example:        date `/usr/bin/readclock` </dev/tty     # Useful in /etc/rc

     Readclock reads the AT's real time clock and prints the result in a form 
useful to date, namely, MMDDYYhhmmss.  If the clock does not exist (e.g., on a 
PC), it outputs "-q" to force 'date' to query the user for the time.  The
example given above can be put in /etc/rc to load the real time.  On an AT,
readclock uses a character device /dev/port, major 1 minor 4.

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
