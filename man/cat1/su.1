Command:        su - temporarily log in as super-user or another user
Syntax:         su [name]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       su                      # Become super-user
                su ast                  # Become ast

     Su can be used to temporarily login as another user.  It prompts for the 
super-user password.  If the correct password is entered, su creates a shell 
with the desired uid.  If no name is specified, root is assumed.  To exit the 
temporary shell, type CTRL-D.
