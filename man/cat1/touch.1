Command:        touch - update a file's time of last modification
Syntax:         touch [-cf] file ...
Flags:          -c      do not create the file
                -f      Minix ignores this flag
Examples:       touch *.h               # Make the .h files look recent

     The time of last modification is set to the current time.  This command 
is mostly used to trick make into thinking that a file is more recent than it 
really is.  If the file being touched does not exist, it is created, unless 
the -c flag is present.
