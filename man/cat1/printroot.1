Syntax:         printroot

Examples:       printroot               # Print the name of the root device
                printroot >/etc/mtab    # Initialise /etc/mtab

     Printroot is useful for initializing the /etc/mtab entry when the system
is booted.  It figures out what the root device is by searching /dev until it
finds a block special file with the right major/minor device numbers.
