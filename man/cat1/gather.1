Command:        gather - gather up the files in a directory for transmission
Syntax:         gather [-s source_dir] [-d dest_dir] [-b max_size] [-f file]
Flags:          -b      desired number of bytes per output file (default 60Kb)
                -d      destination directory for the archives (default ./)
                -f      base name for the archives
                -s      source directory for the files (default ./)
Examples:  gather                       # Put files in ./ into 60K archives
           gather -d dir                # Put the archives in dir
           gather -b 90000              # Try to produce 90K archives

     It is often useful to collect all the files in a directory into one or
more archives for transmission by mail.  This program collects all the files
in the source directory and puts them into a shar archive.  The shar archive
is then compressed and uuencoded.  An attempt is made to have the final .uue
file be about the given size, but since gather cannot really predict how much
shar will add to the file, how much compress will reduce the file, and how
much uue will add again, the final sizes can fluctuate.  If the -f file flag
is given, the archives will be given the names file_00.uue, file_01.uue etc.
If -f is not given, the name of the source directory is used as the base name.
