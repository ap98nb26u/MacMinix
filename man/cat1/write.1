Command:        write - send a message to a logged-in user
Syntax:         write [-cv] user [tty]
Flags:          -c      use cbreak mode
                -v      verbose mode
Examples:       write ast               # Send a message to ast
                write ast tty1          # Send a message to ast on tty0

     Write lets a user send messages to another logged-in user.  Lines typed by
the user appear on the other user's screen a line at a time (a character at a
time in the case of cbreak mode).  The file /etc/utmp is searched to find out
which tty to send the message to.  If the user is logged onto more than one
terminal, the tty argument selects the terminal.  Type CTRL-D to terminate the
command.  Use ! as a shell escape, except when in cbreak mode.

    Files used: /etc/utmp
