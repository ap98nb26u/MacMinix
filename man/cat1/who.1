     Who prints a list of currently logged in users.  For each one, the user 
name, terminal, and login time is printed.  By default, the program gets its
information from the file /etc/utmp (if it exists), which is normally
updated by init and login.  If the optional filename is given, the logins in
that file will be printed.  Do not confuse whoami with 'who am i'.

     Files used: /etc/utmp
