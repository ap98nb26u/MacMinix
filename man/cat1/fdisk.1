Command:        fdisk - partition a hard disk
Syntax:         fdisk [-hno_of_heads] [-sno_of_sectors] [device]
Flags:          (none)
Example:        fdisk                          # use default settings
                fdisk -h4 -s17 /dev/hd0        # actual MINIX defaults

     When fdisk starts up, it reads in the partition table and displays it.  
It then presents a menu to allow the user to modify partitions, store the 
partition table on a file, or load it from a file.  Partitions can be marked 
as DOS or MINIX, and active or not.  The partition type 0x80 should be used
for MINIX before version 1.4b, and 0x81 otherwise.  Where partitions start on
even cylinder boundaries MINIX doesn't care what kind of partition it uses,
except for partition 0. The fact that Minix cannot access the last sector on
an odd-sized partition causes problems when using eg. dosread.  Avoid such
partitions if possible.

    For safety, the device is opened r/o if file permissions do not permit
r/w mode, but be aware that repartitioning a disk may cause information on it
to be lost.  Rebooting the system is mandatory after changing partition sizes.
MINIX, XENIX, PC-IX, MS-DOS and CP/M have different ideas about how partitions
are numbered, and fdisk understands some of them but not all. 

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
