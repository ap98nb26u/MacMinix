     Dis88 is a disassembler.  It takes an executable file and prints the 
symbolic assembly code that corresponds to it, in a form compatible with the
PC/IX assembler.  If the executable file contains a symbol table (added by
the program ast), the symbol table information is used to give a more readable
assembly listing.  The program is described in doc/dis88.doc.
