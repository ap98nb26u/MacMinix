Command:        kill - send a signal to a process
Syntax:         kill [-signal] process
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       kill 35                 # Send signal 15 to process 35
                kill -9 40              # Send signal 9 (SIGKILL) to process 40
                kill -2 0               # Send signal 2 to whole process group

     A signal is sent to a given process.  By default signal 15 (SIGTERM) is 
sent.  Process 0 means all the processes in the sender's process group.
