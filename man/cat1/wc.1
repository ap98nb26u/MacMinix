Command:        wc - count characters, words, and lines in a file
Syntax:         wc [-clw] file ... 
Flags:          -c       print character count
                -l       print line count
                -w       print word count
Examples:       wc file1 file2          # Print all three counts for both files
                wc -l file              # Print line count only

     Wc reads each argument and computes the number of characters, words and 
lines it contains.  A word is delimited by white space (space, tab, line feed
or form feed).  The default is to print all three counts in the order l,w,c.
