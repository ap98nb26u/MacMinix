Command:        dosread - read a file from an MS-DOS diskette
Syntax:         dosread drive [path/]file
Flags:          -a      ASCII file
Examples:       dosread B g/adv >adv    # Copy MSDOS file B:\G\ADV to ./adv
                dosread A -a prog.c >x  # Copy ASCII file A:\PROG.C to ./x  

     Dosread reads one file from an MS-DOS diskette and writes it on standard 
output.  The file name should use slash, not backslash as a separator.  ASCII 
files have the final CTRL-Z stripped, and carriage return plus line feed are 
mapped to line feed only, the usual MINIX convention.

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
