Command:        term - turn an IBM PC into a dumb terminal
Syntax:         term [commdev] [baudrate] [parity] [bits_per_character]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       term 2400               # Talk to modem at 2400 baud
                term 1200 7 even        # 1200 baud, 7 bits/char, even parity
                term /dev/tty2          # Use tty2 instead of tty1

     Term allows MINIX to talk to a terminal or modem over an RS-232 port.  It
uses /dev/tty1 as the default, which can be changed on the command line.  The
program first sets the baudrate, parity and character length, and then forks.
The parent sits in a loop copying from standard input (usually the console's
keyboard), to the terminal or modem.  The child sits in a loop copying from
the terminal or modem to standard output.  Thus when an RS-232 port is
connected to a modem, every keystroke typed on the keyboard is sent to the
modem, and every character arriving from the modem is displayed. Standard
input and output may be redirected, to provide a primitive file transfer
program, with no checking.
     To use term, it is essential that /etc/ttys is configured so that there
is no shell hanging on the tty device used.  If there is, both the shell and
term will try to read from the tty, and nothing will work.  To exit term,
press the middle button on the numeric pad on the IBM PC.

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
