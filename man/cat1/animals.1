     Animals is a guessing game.  The user picks an animal and the computer 
tries to guess it by posing questions that should be answered by typing 'y' 
for yes and 'n' for no.  Whenever the computer loses, it asks some questions 
which allow it to improve its data base, /usr/lib/animals, so that as time
goes on it learns.
