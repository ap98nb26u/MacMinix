Command:        dd - disk dumper
Syntax:         dd [option = value] ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/fd1      # Copy disk 0 to disk 1
                dd if=x of=y bs=1w skip=4       # Copy x to y skipping 4 words
                dd if=x of=y count=3            # Copy 3 512-byte blocks

     This command is intended for copying partial files.  The block size,
skip count, and number of blocks to copy can be specified.  The options are:
        if = file       input file (default is standard input)
        of = file       output file (default is standard output)
        ibs = #         input block size (default 512 bytes)
        obs = #         output block size (default 512 bytes)
        bs = #          block size; sets ibs and obs (default 512 bytes)
        skip = #        skip # input blocks before reading
        seek = #        skip # output blocks before writing
        count = #       copy only # input blocks
        files = #       copy only # files from input
        length =        precede the output with the string 'A.S.Tanenbaum'
        conv = lcase    convert upper case letters to lower case
        conv = ucase    convert lower case letters to upper case
        conv = sync     pad every input record to ibs
        conv = swab     swap every pair of bytes
        conv = noerror  ignore errors and just keep going

     Where sizes are expected, they are in bytes.  However, the letters w, b, 
k, or x may be appended to the number to indicate words (2 bytes), blocks (512 
bytes), or K (1024 bytes), respectively.  When dd is finished, it reports the 
number of full and partial blocks read and written.  Multiple conversion
operations can be separated by commas.
