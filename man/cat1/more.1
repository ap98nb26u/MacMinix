     More is a pager that allows one to examine files.  This program was 
originally produced at the University of California, Berkeley.  When more  
starts up, it displays a screenful of information from the first file in its 
list, and then pauses for one of the following commands.
        #               integer, how many of something.
        <space>         display next page
        <return>        display next line
        CTRL-B          go backward half a screenful
        CTRL-D          go forward half a screenful
        CTRL-L          redraw the screen
        #<space>        go forward # lines
        =               print current line number
        .               repeat previous command
        '               go back to start of last search (single quote)
        !               escape to shell 
        #/<expr>        go to #th occurrence of <expr>
        :f              display current file name and line number
        #:n             skip forward # files
        #:p             skip backward # files
        b               go backward half a screenful
        d               go forward half a screenful
        #f              skip # screenfulls
        h               display /usr/lib/more.help
        #n              go to #th occurrence of last <expr>
        q               quit
        Q               quit 
        #s              skip # lines
        v               execute /usr/bin/vi
        #z              go forward # lines and set screen size to #

    For the benefit of users who always want to use certain flags when calling 
more, the shell variable MORE can be set to the desired default flags, e.g.  
MORE="-p".  Note that the file more.help should be installed in /usr/lib. 

    Files used: /usr/lib/more.help
