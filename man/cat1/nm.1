Command:        nm - print a symbol table
Syntax:         nm [options] [file] ...
Flags:          -d      address in decimal
                -g      print only external symbols
                -n      sort numerically rather than alphabetically
                -o      prepend file name to each line rather than once only
                -p      print in symbol-table order without sorting
                -r      sort in reverse order
                -u      print only undefined symbols
Examples:       nm -n a.out             # Print all symbols in numerical order
                nm -g a.out             # Print global symbols alphabetically

     Nm prints the symbol table of an executable file when it is available. If
no filename is given, the symbols in a.out are used.  The format of the table
is somewhat compatible with the one produced by asld when used with the -s 
option.  The symbol table can be added with ast.  Archives are not supported,
since assembly language files don't have symbol tables.
