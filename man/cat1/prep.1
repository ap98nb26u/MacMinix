Command:        prep - prepare a text file for statistical analysis
Syntax:         prep [file]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       prep infile >outfile    # Prep infile
                prep <infile >outfile   # Prep infile

     Prep strips off most of the troff commands from a text file and then 
outputs all the words, one word per line, in the order they occur in the file.
This file can then be sorted and compared to a dictionary (as a spelling 
checker), or used for statistical analyses.
