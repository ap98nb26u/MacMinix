     Spell is the MINIX spelling checker, a shell script.  First, the program
prep strips off the roff, nroff, and troff control lines and the punctuation,
listing each word on a separate line.  It then sorts the output and compares
it to the dictionary.  Words present in the file but not present in the
dictionary are written to stdout.  The dictionary is kept in /usr/lib.

     Files used: /usr/lib/dictionary
