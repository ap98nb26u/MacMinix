Command:        cat - concatenate files and write them to standard output 
Syntax:         cat [-u] file ...
Flags:          -u      unbuffered output
Examples: cat file              # Display file on the terminal
          cat file1 file2 | lpr # Concatenate two files and print results

     Cat concatenates its input files and copies the result to standard 
output.  If no input file is named, or - is encountered as a file name, 
standard input is used.  Output is buffered in 512 byte blocks unless the -u 
flag is given.
