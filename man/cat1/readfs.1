Command:        readfs - read a MINIX file system
Syntax:         readfs [-il] block_special [dir]
Flags:          -i      give information about the file, but do not extract
                -l      list the files extracted on standard output
Example: readfs -i /dev/hd2             # See whats on /dev/hd2
         readfs -l /dev/at0 rootfs      # Extract and list the filesystem of
                                        # /dev/at0 and put the tree in the
                                        # directory rootfs
                                        
     Readfs reads a floppy disk containing a MINIX file system and extracts
recursively all directories and files, optionally giving a mkfs listing.  The
files extracted can be put in a user-specified directory (default: current 
directory).  If subdirectories are needed, they will be created automatically.
Special files are extracted as ordinary files, but the mkfs-listing enables
mkfs to restore them to original.

     Files used: /usr/bin/mkdir
