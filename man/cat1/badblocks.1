     If a device develops bad sectors, it is important to not have them 
allocated to important files.  This program makes it possible to collect up
to seven bad blocks into a file, so they will not be allocated for a "real"
file.  When the program starts up, if it is not given a list of bad blocks
it asks for them.  Then it creates a file whose name is of the form
.Bad_xxxxx, where xxxxx is a pid.  The numbers of bad sectors can be obtained
from the program diskcheck.
