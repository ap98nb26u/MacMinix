Command:        btoa - binary to ascii conversion
Syntax:         btoa [adhor] [infile] [outfile]
Flags:          -a      decode, rather than encode, the file
                -d      extract repair file from diagnosis file
                -h      display a help menu
                -o      use the obsolete algorithm
                -r      repair a damaged archive file
Examples:       btoa <a.out >a.out.btoa         # Convert a.out to ASCII
                btoa -a <a.out.btoa >a.out      # Reverse the above

     Btoa is a filter that converts a binary file to ascii for transmission
over a telephone line.  If two file names are provided, the first is used for
input and the second for output.  If only one is provided, it is used as the
input file.  The program is functionally similar to uue/uud, but the encoding
is completely different.  The file is expanded about 25 percent in the process.
Files are usually decoded by atob, originally a separate program now included
in btoa.  These two programs are an alternative to uue/uud; both btoa/atob and
uue/uud are widely used, and both have been provided with MINIX.
