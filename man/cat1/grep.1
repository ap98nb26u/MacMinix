Command:        grep - search a file for lines containing a given pattern
Syntax:         grep [-ln] [-s] [-v] [-e] pattern [file] ...
Flags:          -e      -e pattern is the same as pattern
                -l      prints just file names, no lines (overrides -n)
                -n      print line numbers
                -s      give status only, and no printed output
                -v      select lines that do not match the pattern
Examples:       grep mouse file         # Find lines in file containing mouse
                grep [0-9] file         # Print lines containing a digit 

     Grep searches one or more files (by default, standard input) and selects 
out all the lines that match the pattern.  All the regular expressions
accepted by mined are allowed.  In addition, + can be used instead of * to 
mean 1 or more occurrences, ? can be used to mean 0 or 1 occurrences, and | 
can be used between two regular expressions to mean either one of them;
parentheses can be used for grouping.  Grep returns the following exit status:
       0 when a match is found. 
       1 when no match is found
       2 when an error is detected

Note that when the -l and -v flags are used together, only the names of those
files that do not contain the pattern anywhere are listed.
