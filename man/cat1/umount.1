Command:        umount - unmount a mounted file system
Syntax:         umount special
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       umount /dev/fd1    # Unmount floppy disk 1

     A mounted file system is unmounted after the cache has been flushed to 
disk.  A floppy disk should never be removed while it is mounted.  If this
happens, and is discovered before another floppy disk is inserted, the 
original one can be replaced without harm.  Attempts to unmount a file system 
holding working directories or open files will be rejected with a 'device 
busy' message.

    Files used: /etc/mtab
