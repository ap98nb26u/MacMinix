Command:        uud - decode a binary file encoded with uue
Syntax:         uud [-nd] [-s srcdir] [-t dstdir] file
Flags:          -       take input from stdin
                -d      debugging information
                -n      do not verify checksums
                -s dir  get .uue (source) file from directory dir
                -t dir  put output in (target) directory dir
Examples:       uud file.uue            # Re-create the original file
                uud - <file.uue         # Take input from stdin

     Uud decodes a file encoded with uue or UNIX uuencode.  The decoded file is
given the name that the original file had.  The name information is part of the
encoded file.  Mail headers and other junk before the encoded file are skipped.
