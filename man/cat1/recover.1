     MINIX allows files that have been deleted (eg. with rm) to be restored.
The trick is that when a file is unlinked, its old i-node number is put in the 
last two bytes of the old file name in the directory.  As long as the directory
entry and disk blocks are not reused, the file can be recovered.  This program
is actually just a front end for de, which must be installed and executable.
Wildcards are not allowed in the filename(s), and only the first twelve
characters of the name are significant.

     Files used: /usr/bin/de
