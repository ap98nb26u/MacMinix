Command:        help - give help about a command
Syntax:         help [name]
Flags:          (none)
Example:        help uuencode

     Help gives help about a given command name (or help itself, if none is
specified).  It gets its information from /usr/lib/helpfile, which should be
linked to doc/man_pages.  To improve performance, it builds an index file,
/usr/lib/helpfile.idx; this is automatically updated when it becomes older
than /usr/lib/helpfile.  Lines in the helpfile beginning with # contain the
keywords for help.

     Files used: /usr/lib/helpfile
