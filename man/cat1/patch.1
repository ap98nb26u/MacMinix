Command:        patch - update a file from the original and a diff
Syntax:         patch [option] ... old_file diff_file
Flags:          +       change flags between successive patches
                -B pre  next argument is backup filename prefix
                -D lbl  mark changes with "#ifdef...#endif", next arg is label
                -F#     sets a maximum fuzz factor of # (default 2)
                -N      ignore patches that are reversed or already applied
                -R      patch created with old and new files swapped!
                -S      ignore a patch
                -b ext  next argument is backup extension, instead of .orig
                -c      interpret the patch file as a context diff
                -d dir  cd to the next arg (assumed a directory)
                -e      interpret the patch file as an ed script
                -f      forces patch to do its work without asking questions
                -l      do matching loosely (all white space is equivalent)
                -n      interpret the patch file as a normal diff
                -o out  next argument is the output file name
                -p#     sets the pathname strip count to #
                -r fil  names the reject file as fil 
                -v      print program version number
                -s      silent mode
                -x      used for debugging
Example:        patch file difflist             # Fix up file with difflist
                patch <patchfile                # Do it automatically

     Patch takes an original file and a diff listing and recreates the new 
file.  It is functionally similar to fix, but much more powerful.  Not only 
can it handle normal diffs, but also context diffs produced by cdiff.  In 
addition, it works even when the file being patched has other changes to it.  
It deduces the type of difflist itself (unless given -c, -e, or -n).  The 
normal usage is given in the example above.  In this case patch will modify 
'file' to incorporate all the patches.  The original file is renamed 'file~'.
The program is described in doc/patch.doc.
