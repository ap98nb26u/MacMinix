Command:        [ - test for a condition
Syntax:         if [ expr ]
Flags:          (none)
Example:        if [ -f file ]          # Test if file is readable

     [ is a link to the file 'test', used to improve the clarity of scripts.
Test checks to see if files exist, are readable, etc.  and returns an exit
status of zero if true and non-zero if false.  The legal operators are:

        -r file         true if the file is readable
        -w file         true if the file is writable 
        -f file         true if the file is not a directory
        -d file         true if the file is a directory
        -s file         true if the file exists and has a size > 0
        -t fd           true if file descriptor fd (default 1) is a terminal
        -z s            true if the string s has zero length
        -n s            true if the string s has non-zero length
        s1 = s2         true if the strings s1 and s2 are identical
        s1 != s2        true if the strings s1 and s2 are different
        m -eq m         true if the integers m and n are numerically equal

     The operators -gt, -ge, -ne, -le, -lt may be used as well.  These operands
may be combined with -a (Boolean and), -o (Boolean or), ! (negation).  The 
priority of -a is higher than that of -o.  Parentheses are permitted, but must 
be escaped to keep the shell from trying to interpret them.
     If test is linked to /usr/bin/[ structures such as if [ -f file ] can be
used to improve clarity.
