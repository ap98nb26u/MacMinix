Command:        rsh - remote shell for networking
Syntax:         rsh port [-bei]
Flags:          -b      start the rsh in the background
                -e      keep stderr separate from stdout
                -i      take input from the local process
Examples:       rsh machine5 ls -l /usr/bin     # List remote bin directory
                rsh abc cat /usr/doc/f >f       # Fetch remote file
                rsh foobar                      # Log onto remote machine

     The remote shell command is the way to have a distant server carry out a 
command over the Ethernet.  The port given as the first argument can be any 
string of up to 6 characters, but it must match the port used by some sherver.
The command will be executed and the results returned on stdout.  Unless the 
-e flag is given, the remote stderr and stdout are merged onto the local 
stdout.  Giving rsh with just a port and no argument is the standard way to 
log onto a remote machine.
