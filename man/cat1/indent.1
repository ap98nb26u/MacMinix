     Indent is a C program formatter.  It reformats the C program in the input-
file according to the switches.  It has an enormous number of options which are
listed in the file doc/indent.doc.
     If you only specify an input-file, the formatting is done in-place, that
is, the formatted file is written back into input-file and a backup copy of
input-file is written in the current directory.  If input-file is named
'/blah/blah/file', the backup file is named file.BAK.
     You may set up your own profile of defaults to indent by creating a file
called .indent.pro in either your login directory and/or the current directory
and including whatever switches you like.
