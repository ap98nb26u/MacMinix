Command:        getty - get the terminal line parameters for login
Syntax:         getty line [-c file] [-h] [-k] [-t] [speed]
Flags:          -c fn   use file fn as gettydefs file
                -h      do not hang up phone after reset
                -k      do not use speed selection
                -t      do not time-out at login prompt
Examples:       getty /dev/tty1 1200            # Connect to tty1
                getty /dev/tty1 console         # Connect to console

     The getty program allows a terminal port to be used for both dialin and
dialout.  It can also detect user speed, and set various line parameters. On
startup, getty searches the gettydefs file for an entry which matches the
given speed parameter, and sets up the terminal line in accordance with the
initial parameters of that gettydef entry.  If no match is found, or getty
is called without a second argument, the first entry in the file is used.
     Once the terminal is set up, getty waits for a carrier detect signal, and
when one is received it prints the contents of the /etc/issue file, usually
the system name.  It then prompts for a login name, and on receipt of this
resets the terminal parameters to the final gettydef entry parameters, and
calls login with the given username as an argument.
     If it is called as uugetty, getty will prepare the line for uucp.  If
/etc/utmp and /usr/adm/wtmp exist, getty will handle user accounting.

     Files used: /etc/gettydefs
                 /etc/issue
                 /etc/utmp
                 /usr/adm/wtmp
