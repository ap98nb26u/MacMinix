Command:        gres - grep and substitute
Syntax:         gres [-g] pattern string [file] ...
Flags:          -g      change only the first occurrence on each line

                gres "^[A-Z]+$" CAPS    # Replace capitals-only lines with CAPS

     Gres is a poor man's sed.  It looks for the same patterns as grep, and
replaces each one by the given string.
