Command:        fix - update a file from a difflist
Syntax:         fix oldfile difflist >newfile
Flags:          (none)
Example:        fix old difflist >new   # Generate new from old and diffs

     Fix accepts a diff listing produced by diff and reconstructs the new 
file.  It is common for people to take a file, modify it, and then send the 
diff listing between the old and new files to other people.  Using fix, the  
old file, and the diff listing, it is possible to create the new file.  For 
example:
        diff oldfile newfile >difflist
        fix oldfile difflist >new2

will generate a file new2 that is identical to newfile.  A more sophisticated
alternative to fix is patch.
