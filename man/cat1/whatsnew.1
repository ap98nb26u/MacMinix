Syntax:         whatsnew [-#] file.c file.c.cdif
Flags:          -#      set output line length to # (default 80)
Examples:       whatsnew file.c file.c.cdif     # Print file.c marking changes

     It often occurs that cdifs are posted to USENET. After installing a cdif
file, it is sometimes desirable to print out the new file, with the changes
marked on it.  Whatsnew does precisely this, with the changes + and ! printed
in the right-hand margin.  Output lines are forced to a standard length to
make the symbols easy to find.
