Command:        ci - check in an SVC revision
Syntax:         ci [-lu] file
Flags:          -l      after checking in, check back out again and lock
                -u      after checking in, do not delete the file
Examples:       ci -u Makefile          # Check Makefile back in
                ci -l newfile           # Create SVC file for newfile, relock

     Ci checks the specified file into its SVC archive. If an SVC archive file
did not exist, one is created with the name "file,S". (If a directory named
"SVC" is present in the same directory as "file", the archive will be placed
there instead.) 
     A log message will be prompted for, and read from standard input; this
may be several lines, terminated with "." on a line by itself or EOT. After
the file has been checked in, the default action is to remove the source
file. If "-u" is specified, the file will not be unlinked, but all write
permissions will be removed. If "-l" is specified, a lock is placed on
the SVC archive, and the file will remain writable by the owner. SVC archive
files are always read-only.
    Version numbers start at "1" and are incremented by one for each revision
checked in.
