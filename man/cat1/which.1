Command:        which - examine $PATH to see which file will be executed
Syntax:         which name ...
Flags:          (none)

     The $PATH shell variable controls the MINIX search rules. If a command
a.out is given, which first tries to find an executable file in the working
directory.  If that fails, it looks in various system directories, such as
/bin and /usr/bin.  The which command makes the same search and gives the
path of the program that will be chosen.
