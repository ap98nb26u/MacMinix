Command:        leave - warn when it is time to go home
Syntax:         leave [ [+] hh[:]mm]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       leave 1500              # Issue a warning at 2:55 p.m.
                leave 10:00             # Issue a warning at 9:55 a.m.
                leave + 30              # Issue a warning in 25 minutes.

     Leave sets an alarm clock to a specified time and issues a warning 5 
minutes before, 1 minute before, and at the time to leave.  It then keeps 
issuing warnings every minute for 10 minutes, then quits.  If no time is 
provided, the program prompts for one.  Leave uses the login/logout records
kept in /usr/adm/wtmp if they exist; to switch off the alarm, kill the process.
