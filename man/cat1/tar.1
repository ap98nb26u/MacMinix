     Tar is an archiver in the style of the standard tape archiver, except 
that it does not use tape.  It's primary advantage over ar is that the tar  
format is somewhat more standardised than the ar format, making it 
theoretically possible to transport MINIX files to another computer, but do 
not bet on it.  If the target machine runs MS-DOS, try doswrite.
