     Cal prints a calendar for a month or year.  The year can be between 1 and 
9999.  Note that the year 87 is not a synonym for 1987, but is itself a valid 
year about 19 centuries ago.  The calendar produced is the one used by England 
and her colonies.  Try Sep 1752, Feb 1900, and Feb 2000.  If you don't 
understand what is going on, look up "Calendar, Gregorian" in a good 
encyclopedia.
