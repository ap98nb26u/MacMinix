Command:        fgrep - fast grep
Syntax:         fgrep [option] ... [file] [string] [file] ...
Flags:          -c      count matching lines and print only count
                -e      take string from next argument 
                -f      take strings from file named in next argument
                -h      omit file headers from printout
                -l      list file names once only
                -n      each line is preceded by its line number
                -s      status only, no output
                -v      print only lines not matching
Examples:       fgrep # prog.c                  # Print lines containing # sign
                fgrep -f pattern prog.c         # Take strings from 'pattern'

     Fgrep is essentially the same as grep, except that it only searches for 
lines containing literal strings (no wildcard characters), and it is much 
faster.
