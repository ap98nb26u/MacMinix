Command:        uue - encode a binary file using ASCII
                uue [-#] file [-]
Flags:          -       output to stdout
                -#      maximum of # lines per file
Examples:       uue file                # Encode file to file.uue
                uue file - >x           # Encode file and write on stdout
                uue -800 file           # Output on file.uaa, file.uab etc.

     Uuuencode is a famous program that converts an arbitrary (usually binary)
file to an encoding using only 64 ASCII characters.  Uudecode converts it back
to the original file.  The uue and uud programs are the MINIX versions of these
programs, and are compatible with the UNIX ones.  The files produced can even
be sent successfully over BITNET, which is notorious for mangling files.
     It is possible to have uue automatically split the encoded file up into
chunks small enough to fit into mail messages.  The output files then get the
suffixes .uaa, .uab, etc., instead of .uue.  When uud is given file .uaa to
decode, it automatically includes the subsequent pieces.  The encoding takes
3 bytes (24 bits) from the input file and renders it as 4 bytes in the output
file.  See also the description of uud.
