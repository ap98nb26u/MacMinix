Command:        ast - add a symbol table to an executable file
Syntax:         ast [-xX] [objfile1] [symfile]
Flags:          -x      do not preserve local symbols
                -X      preserve local symbols, except for those starting
                        with 'I' which are compiler-generated
Examples:       ast     # Add default symbol table file symbol.out to
                        # default object file a.out

     Ast adds the symbol table produced by the -s option of asld to the  
executable file.  If no file is given, 'a.out' is assumed.  If no symbol table
file is listed, the default name 'symbol.out' is used.  When one file is given,
it must be the executable.  The symbol table can be generated by the command:

        cc -s file.c >symbol.out.

     This is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
