Command:        dhrystone - integer benchmark
Syntax:         dhrystone
Flags:          (none)
Example:        dhrystone               # Run the dhrystone benchmark

     Many years ago, a floating-point benchmark called whetstone was popular
for benchmarking FORTRAN programs.  Nowadays, an integer benchmark called
dhrystone is widely used for benchmarking UNIX systems.  This is it.  Be
warned, however, that dhrystone is entirely CPU bound, and goes blindingly
fast on machines with high-speed caches.  Although this is a good measure for
programs that spend most of their time in some inner loop, it is a poor
benchmark for I/O bound applications.
