Command:        ln - create a link to a file
Syntax:         ln file [name]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       ln file newname         # Make newname a synonym for file
                ln /usr/games/chess     # Create a link called chess 

     A directory entry is created for name.  The entry points to file.  
Henceforth, name and file can be used interchangeably.  If name is not 
supplied, the last component of file is used as the link name and the
link is created in the current directory.
