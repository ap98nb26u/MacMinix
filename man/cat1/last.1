Command:        last - display the user log-in history
Syntax:         last [-f file] [-r] [-#] [name] [tty] ...
Flags:          -f      use file instead of /usr/adm/wtmp
                -r      search backwards only to last reboot
                -#      print a maximum of n lines

Examples:       last reboot             # When was the system last rebooted?
                last ast                # When was the last login for ast?
                last -10 tty0 tty1      # Display last 10 logins on tty0/tty1

     Last searches backward through the login administration file (default is
/usr/adm/wtmp), printing information about previous logins, logouts, shutdowns
and reboots.  During a long search, the SIGQUIT signal (CTRL-\) causes last to
display how far back it has gone; it then continues.

     Files used: /usr/adm/wtmp
