Syntax:         uniq [-cdu] [+#] [-#] [input [output]]

                +#      skip the first # fields when matching
                -c      give count of identical input lines
                -d      write only duplicate lines to output
                -u      write only unique lines to output
Examples:       uniq +2 file            # Ignore first two fields in matching
                uniq -d in out          # Write duplicate lines to file out

     Uniq examines a file for consecutive lines that are identical.  All but 
duplicate entries are deleted, and the file is written to output.  When both
fields and spaces are being skipped, fields are skipped first.
