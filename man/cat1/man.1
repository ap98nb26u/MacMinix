Command:        man - display a manual page
Syntax:         man [manual-directory] [#] [name] ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       man cdiff               # Display man page for cdiff(1)

     Man is a program that displays manual pages, which are stored in the
directory /usr/man, one volume per file.  When called with just a program
name, man displays the page for that program, if it can be found in the
default volume (man1).  Man builds an index for each file in the /usr/man
directory, and updates these whenever a man file becomes more recent than
its current index file.
     When the digit # is given as an argument, the volume /usr/man/man# is
used instead of the default volume.  When no name is given (or just a digit),
the list of pages in that volume is displayed.  The cursor keys can be used to
select an entry, and <return> then displays the page selected.  Q or q leaves
the program.  A directory name can be given to override the use of /usr/man.

     Files used: /usr/man/man1, etc.
                 /usr/man/._man1, etc.
