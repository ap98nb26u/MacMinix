Command:        login - log into the computer
Syntax:         login [user]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       login ast               # Login as ast

     If login is given a username as an argument, it allows a logged in user
to login as someone else without first logging out.  If a password is needed,
login will prompt for it.  Login will time out after 30 seconds, and will
delay after a bad username is entered.  If the file /etc/nologin exists, no
logins will be permitted.  If the file /etc/motd exists, login will print it
on the standard output immediately after a successful login. 

     If /usr/adm/wtmp or /etc/utmp exist login will use them for accounting
purposes, as will init.  (They will also be used by other programs such as
write).  If these files do not exist, neither init nor login will create them.
Note that the files, once created, will grow forever and eventually fill the
disk unless they are manually truncated from time to time.

     Files used: /usr/adm/wtmp
                 /etc/utmp
                 /etc/nologin
                 /etc/motd
