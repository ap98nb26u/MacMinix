Command:        chown - change owner
Syntax:         chown user file ...
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       chown ast file1 file2   # Make ast the owner of the files
                chown ast.user file3    # Make ast the owner, user the group

     The owner field of the named files is changed to user (ie., login name 
specified).  Alternatively, a decimal uid may be specified instead of a user 
name.  Only the super-user may execute this command.  This is the same program
as chgrp.
