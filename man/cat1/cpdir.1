Command:        cpdir - copy a directory and its subdirectories
Syntax:         cpdir [-msv] srcdir destdir
Flags:          -m      merge - copy into an existing directory
                -s      similar - preserves the full mode, uid, gid and times
                -v      verbose - cpdir says what it is doing
Examples:       cpdir dir1 dir2 # creat dir2 and copy dir1's files into it

     Cpdir creates the target directory, goes into it, and copies all the 
files in the source directory to it.  When it is done, the target directory
contains the same files as the source directory.  Subdirectories are copied
recursively.  Links and special files are ignored.
