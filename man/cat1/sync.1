Command:        sync - flush the cache to disk
Syntax:         sync
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       sync                    # Write out all modified cache blocks

     MINIX maintains a cache of recently used disk blocks.  The sync command 
writes any modified cache blocks back to the disk.  This is essential before 
stopping the system, and should be done before running any a.out program that 
might crash the system.  Logging out with CTRL-D does an automatic sync.
