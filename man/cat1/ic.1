Command:        ic - integer calculator
Syntax:         ic [expression]
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       ic              # Start the calculator
                ic 250 300+     # Start calculator with 550 on the stack

     Ic is a reverse Polish notation calculator that works on 32-bit integers.
It starts out by computing the expression given as an argument, if any, and
then expects keyboard input.  As an example, to compute `23+5' one first
converts this to reverse Polish, `23 5+'.  After the calculator starts, type
`23' followed by a carriage return.  Then type `5' and another carriage return.
Finally type `+' to see the result, 28 displayed on the stack.  Other
operations work the same way.  The calculator can use other radices for input
and output, and has registers that can be stored and loaded.  The h command
gives the help menu, and the program is described in doc/ic.doc.
