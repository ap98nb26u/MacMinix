Command:        ed - editor
Syntax:         ed file
Flags:          (none)
Example:        ed prog.c               # Edit prog.c

    Ed is functionally equivalent to the standard V7 editor, ed.  It supports
the following commands:

       (.)     a: append
       (.,.)   c: change
       (.,.)   d: delete
               e: edit new file
               f: print name of edited file
       (1,$)   g: global command
       (.)     i: insert
       (.,.+1) j: join lines together
       (.)     k: mark
       (.)     l: print with special characters in octal
       (.,.)   m: move
       (.,.)   p: print
               q: quit editor
       (.)     r: read in new file
       (.,.)   s: substitute
       (1,$)   v: like g, except select lines that do not match
       (1,$)   w: write out edited file

     Many of the commands can take one or two addresses, as indicated above.  
The defaults are shown in parentheses.  Thus 'a' appends to the current line, 
and 'g' works on the whole file as default.  The dot refers to the current 
line.  Below is a sample editing session with comments given following the # 
symbol.
       ed prog.c                # edit prog.c
       3,20p                    # print lines 3 through 20
       /whole/                  # find next occurence of 'whole'
       s/whole/while/           # replace 'whole' by 'while'
       g/Buf/s//BUF/g           # replace 'MAXBUF' by 'MAX_BUF' everywhere
       w                        # write the file back
       q                        # exit the editor
