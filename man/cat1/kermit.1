     Kermit is a file transfer program, remote connection program, and much
more.  It is widely used for mainframe/micro communications.  Even summarizing
it here would be out of the question.  For a description of it, see the 379
page book 'Kermit: A File Transfer Protocol' by Frank da Cruz, Digital Press,
1987, ISBN 0-932376-88-6, and the file doc/kermit.doc.
     On startup, kermit looks for the file .kermrc in the current or home
directory, and runs any commands that it contains. 

    Files used: .kermrc
