                od -c file +10.b        # Dump file starting at block 10

     Od dumps a file in one or more formats.  If file is missing, standard 
input is dumped.  The offset argument tells od to skip a certain number of 
bytes or blocks before starting.  The offset is in octal bytes, unless it is 
followed by a '.' for decimal or b for blocks or both.
