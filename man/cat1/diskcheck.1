Command:        diskcheck - check a disk for bad sectors
Syntax:         diskcheck device start_block block_count
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       diskcheck /dev/at0 0 1200       # Check 1.2 MB floppy
                diskcheck /dev/at0 100 1100     # Check floppy from block 100

     Diskcheck checks a disk for bad sectors by reading in each sector, 
writing a known bit pattern onto it, reading it back in and comparing with 
what was written.  This check is then done a second time.  Bad sectors are 
reported.  After each sector is tested, the original sector is restored.
