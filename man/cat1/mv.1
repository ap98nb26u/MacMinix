Command:        mv - move or rename a file
Syntax:         mv file1 file2
                mv file ... directory
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       mv oldname newname      # Move oldname to newname
                mv file1 file2 /usr/ast # Move two files to /usr/ast

     Mv moves one or more files from one place in the file system to another.  
If the old path and new path are on the same device, it is done by linking and
unlinking, otherwise by copying.  Move won't move '.' and '..'.  Move will
allow the owner to move from a non-writable file, but not to one.  Target
files are deleted when moving to a directory.

     Files used: /usr/bin/cp
