Command:        to - output half of a connection
Syntax:         to port
Flags:          (none)
Example:        cat f1 f2 | to mach4    # Send the catted files to port

     To and from are used together to provide connection-oriented service.  On 
the sending machine, the last member of a pipeline is 'to port'.  On the 
receiving machine, the first member of a pipe line is 'from port'.  The net 
result is that the output of the sending pipeline goes into the input of the 
receiving pipeline, making pipelines work across the network.  As a simple 
example, consider:
        on machine1:    cat f1 f2 | to Johnny
        on machine2:    from Johnny | sort >x

     The effect of these two commands is that the files f1 and f2 are 
concatenated, transferred to machine 2, and sorted their, with the output 
going to a file x on machine 2.  The string Johnny is used by the transaction 
system to identify which sender goes with which receiver; any unique string 
can be used.
