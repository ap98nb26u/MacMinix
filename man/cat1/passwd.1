     Passwd is used to change your password.  It prompts for the old and new 
passwords.  It asks for the new password twice, to reduce the effect of a 
typing error.  If /etc is in RAM, do not forget to copy the modified password
file back to the root file system diskette, or the changes will be lost when
the system is shutdown.  Note that there are problems with the Minix password
encryption, which is not particularly secure.

     Files used: /etc/passwd
                 /etc/pwtemp
