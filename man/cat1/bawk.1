     Awk is a pattern matching language.  Programs are a sequence of pattern-
action statements.  Input lines are scanned for a matching pattern, and if this
is found the associated action is taken.  Bawk is Brodt's Awk, a near subset
of the original.  The file name - can be used to designate standard input.
The language is described in doc/bawk.doc.
