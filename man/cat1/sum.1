Command:        sum - compute the checksum and block count of a file
Syntax:         sum file 
Flags:          (none)
Examples:       sum /usr/ast/xyz        # Checksum /usr/ast/xyz

     Sum computes the checksum of one or more files.  It is most often used to 
see if a file copied from another machine has been correctly received.  This 
program works best when both machines use the same checksum algorithm.
