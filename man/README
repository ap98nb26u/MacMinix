This directory contains the man files.  Man1 is "official" in the sense that 
it is not expected to undergo many changes, other than bug fixes.  
Man2 wass put together in an hour.  Someday a proper POSIX version of man2,
as well as man3 (library), man4 (device drivers), man5 (file formats),
and man6 (other) may appear.  Given the nature of MINIX systems and users,
the distinction between part 1 (serious commands), part 6 (games), and
part 8 (superuser commands) is very subtle.  I'll put all commands in Part 1.

If there are any volunteers who want to write the descriptions for the POSIX 
and ANSI functions, please let me know.  In any event, it is absolutely
illegal to copy text from 4.3 BSD manuals, System V manuals, ANSI standards,
IEEE standards, or any other copyrighted work.  You have to write your own.

People writing man entries are requested to keep them short enough to fit on
one screen (24 lines), where possible.  The original file should be in troff
form, with the manX entries being the nroff output.
I may include the man pages in the book again (see pages 384-409 in the book).
To do this, I need input setup for typesetting.
Below is a sample original entry.  All my man1 entries are in this form.
P-H would not approve of my distributing the true input :-(  
Please don't ask.  

Note that I use \(en for the short dash.  
True troff connoisseurs are concerned about the difference between:
     -      \(en      \(em      \(mi      _      and      \(ru
I have gotten artwork from P-H where they used - when I wanted \(en and
I rejected the whole lot at no mean expense.

\fIBackup\fR (recursively) backs up the contents of a given directory and its
subdirectories to another part of the file system.
It is two typical uses.
First, some portion of the file system can be backed up onto 1 or more
diskettes.
When a diskette fills up, the user is prompted for a new one.
The backups are in the form of mountable file systems.
Second, a directory on RAM disk can be backed up onto hard disk.
If the target directory is empty, the entire source directory is copied
there, optionally compressed to save space.
If the target directory is an old backup, only those files changed since
the backup was made are copied.
\fIBackup\fR uses times for this purpose, like \fImake\fR.


For part 2 (will be the ca. 80 POSIX calls) and part 3 (other lib routines,
hopefully most ANSI compatible), follow this example:

.NA "fseek \(en seek on a file"
.SX "fseek(FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence)"
.DE
\fIFseek\fR sets the file position for \fIstream\fR.
The \fIoffset\fR parameter tells where to put it depending on \fIwhence\fR.
\fIWhence\fR can take on one of three values: SEEK_SET (set the file position
to \fIoffset\fR), SEEK_CUR (\fIoffset\fR is relative to the current position),
or SEEK_END (\fIoffset\fR is relative to the end of the file).
.DI
On error, -1 is returned ...
.SA
lseek(2), fopen(3)
.BU
No known bugs
