DESCRIPTION
	  These	functions perform conversion from one data type	to
				  
	  another.
	  The function int converts to integer form its	real, double
	  precision, complex, or double	complex	argument.  If the
	  argument is real or double precision,	int returns the
	  integer whose	magnitude is the largest integer that does not
	  exceed the magnitude of the argument and whose sign is the
	  same as the sign of the argument (i.e., truncation). For
	  complex types, the above rule	is applied to the real part.
	  ifix and idint convert only real and double precision
	  arguments respectively.
	  The function real converts to	real form an integer, double
	  precision, complex, or double	complex	argument.  If the
	  argument is double precision or double complex, as much
	  precision is kept as is possible. If the argument is one of
	  the complex types, the real part is returned.	 float and
	  sngl convert only integer and	double precision arguments
	  respectively.
	  The function dble converts any integer, real,	complex, or
	  double complex argument to double precision form.  If	the
	  argument is of a complex type, the real part is returned.
	  The function cmplx converts its integer, real, double
	  precision, or	double complex argument(s) to complex form.
	  The function dcmplx converts to double complex form its
	  integer, real, double	precision, or complex argument(s).
	  Either one or	two arguments may be supplied to cmplx and
	  dcmplx . If there is only one	argument, it is	taken as the
	  real part of the complex type	and an imaginary part of zero
	  is supplied. If two arguments	are supplied, the first	is
	  taken	as the real part and the second	as the imaginary part.
	  The function ichar converts from a character to an integer
	  depending on the character's position	in the collating
	  sequence.
	  The function char returns the	character in the ith position
	  in the processor collating sequence where i is the supplied
	  argument.
	  For a	processor capable of representing n characters,
	  ichar(char(i)) = i for 0 < i < n, and
	  char(ichar(ch)) = ch for any representable character ch.
