While re-reading Advanced Unix Programming by Marc J. Rochkind, I ran
across some routines that I thought others might find useful.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The lock and unlock functions can be used like this:
	    if (lock("database")) {
		... manipulate database...
		unlock("database");
	    }
	    else
		...couldn't obtain lock...
The name "database" is abstract, it could have been called anything.
If two or more processes are concurrentlyu executing this code, the lock will
prevent them from simultaneously executing the protected section(manipulate
database). All processes would have to call the lock function for this to
work though.
As an enhancement you could write the pid and time on the file so other
processes could see who has it and for how long.(If this is done the permis-
sions should be set to octal 444 instead of 0).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Statutil.c is a program that allows you to do several different functions on
files;
    change modification time, owner, permissions
    display type of file(dir, ordinary, block, character)
	    device number(major, minor), number of links to file,
	    I-node number, Size, group id, owner, last mod. time
All done interactively.
