Here is a reposting of my man(1) program, which works very much like the
real Unix man; you need to build directories like

	/usr/man/manx		- holds nroff'able mans for section x
	/usr/man/catx		- holds cat'able mans for section x

The program supports the MANPATH and PAGER environment variables. The
first can be set to hold one or more directories which hold manuals; for
example, my MANPATH looks like "/usr/local/man:/usr/man". The PAGER variable
holds the man of the program used to page through the manual - I use "less".

For each manual directory, you need to supply a `whatis' file for man(1) to
find the manuals. Documentation on this is supplied. Also supplied is a
patch to 1.5 nroff(1) to allow the output to less to be readable. Also
supplied is a slightly changed tmac.an for nroff, which knows about some
manual macros that the 1.5 tmac.an didn't.

This version has been patched to work on the 680x0 versions of Minix.
