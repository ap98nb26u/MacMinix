The on-line manual pages are now available via anonymous ftp from
ccadfa.cc.adfa.oz.au [131.236.1.2] in the file Minix/mantar.Z. The file
contains the section 1, 3 and 6 manuals that were posted for Minix 1.5, and
the section 2 manual from a previous version (probably 1.4) - no, I've not
seen sections 2 manuals for 1.5. Also included is the whatis file, see below.

The manuals have been separated so that they can be accessed in a Unix
convention. Herewith the program to do this (shar'd, compressed, uue'd).
The README from the shar follows:


Here is a reposting of my man(1) program, which works very much like the
real Unix man; you need to build directories like

	/usr/man/manx		- holds nroff'able mans for section x
	/usr/man/catx		- holds cat'able mans for section x

The program supports the MANPATH and PAGER environment variables. The
first can be set to hold one or more directories which hold manuals; for
example, my MANPATH looks like "/usr/local/man:/usr/man". The PAGER variable
holds the man of the program used to page through the manual - I use "less".

For each manual directory, you need to supply a `whatis' file for man(1) to
find the manuals. Documentation on this is supplied. Also supplied is a
patch to 1.5 nroff(1) to allow the output to less to be readable. Also
supplied is a slightly changed tmac.an for nroff, which knows about some
manual macros that the 1.5 tmac.an didn't.

This version has been patched to work on the 680x0 versions of Minix.
Bug reports etc. please. Also, if somebody would like to write a script
of some sort to build a whatis file from the manuals I'd be very happy.
