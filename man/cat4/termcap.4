File:   termcap - terminal capability database

     /etc/termcap is an ASCII file that lists the capabilities of many 
different types of terminal.  Programs can read termcap to find the particular
escape codes needed to control the visual attributes of the terminal actually
in use.  (Other aspects of the terminal are handled by stty.)  The termcap
database is indexed on the TERM environment variable, which is set by login
to the default of 'Minix', and which can be reset by the program tset.

     Termcap entries must be defined on a single logical line, with '\' used
to suppress the newline.  Fields are separated by ':'.  The first field must
start at the left-hand margin, and contain a list of names for the terminal,
separated by '|'. Subsequent fields contain the terminal capabilities; any
continued capability lines must be indented one tab from the left margin.

     A typical Minix /etc/termcap is:

 # Minix Termcap
 #	Modified by Glen Overby <overby@plains.nodak.edu> 3/4/90
 #		Added insert/delete line, character, etc.  Now supports
 #		everything the console impliments that Termcap can use.
