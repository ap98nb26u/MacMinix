File:   profile - set up general environment at login

     /etc/profile is a shell script which is run by the shell on login to
set up the general environment for every user, before the individual's
$HOME/.profile is run.  

     A typical Minix /etc/profile is:

 # Set default file creation mask
 umask 022
