File:   ttytype - terminal name and device list

     /etc/ttytype is an ASCII file that lists the names of terminals, as
used in termcap, in association with the names of the ttys to which they
are attatched.  It is used by the program tset to set the environment
variable TERM to the correct terminal name for the user's current tty.

     A typical Minix /etc/ttytype is:

 minix tty0
 am230 tty1
 vt100 tty2
