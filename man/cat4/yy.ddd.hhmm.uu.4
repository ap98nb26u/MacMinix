File:   yy.ddd.hhmm.uu - spool files used by atrun

     /usr/spool/at/yy.ddd.hhmm.uu is an ASCII file created by the program
at and used by the program atrun to set up an environment and run a
command.  The filename consists of the year, day, hour and minute that
the command is to be run, together with a random number to avoid confusion
between similar times.

     Atrun is usually run once a minute by cron; each time it is run, it
executes all pending commands and moves the files used to the directory
/usr/spool/at/past.

     A typical Minix yy.ddd.hh.mm file is 90.243.2300.13, which prints the
working directory at 2300 on 1 September.
