File:   fortune.dat - a fortune cookie database used by fortune

     /usr/lib/fortune.dat is a database used by the fortune program, which
is often run at logon.  Fortune.dat is an ASCII file of short remarks,
separated by lines containing only %%.  Fortune picks an entry at random
and displays it.

     A typical Minix /usr/lib/fortune.dat is:

 %%
 A bore is a man who, when you ask him how he is, tells you.
   - B. L. Taylor
 %%
 Oh gracious, why wasn't I born old and ugly?
  - Dickens
 %%

 and so on.
