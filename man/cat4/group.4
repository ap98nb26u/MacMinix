File:   group - group identity

     /etc/group is an ASCII file which defines the groups to which users
belong.  There is one entry per line, and each line has the format:

        group_name:passwd:GID:user_list

     The field descriptions are:

        group_name     the name of the group.
        password       the (encrypted) group password.  If this field is
                            empty, no password is needed.
        GID            the numerical group ID.
        user_list      all the group member's user names, separated by commas.

     A typical Minix /etc/group is:

 root::0:root
 other::1:
 bin::2:root,bin,daemon
 sys::3:root,bin,sys,adm
 adm::4:root,adm,daemon
 uucp::5:uucp
 mail::7:root
 daemon::12:root,daemon
 cron::16:
 lp::18:lp
 mem::20:
 sysadmin::23:sysadmin
 group::50:
