File:  core - image of aborted process

     ./core is the file produced when a process is aborted and removed from
the 'core'.  It is a partial image of the Minix system state.

     When a process receives a signal that cannot or should not be caught,
the memory manager tries to write an image out to disk before removing
the process.  The image file is named 'core' and is written to the working
directory of the process, if MM has the right permissions.

     The first part of a core file is a memory map of all the segments,
followed by the kernel process table, and then all the segments themselves.
