File:   man - manual for commands and system

     /usr/man/man{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} are ASCII files which contain the Minix
manual.  They are used by the man command, which automatically builds an
index whenever a man file is updated.  The man files entries are multi-line
records separated by index lines, which are lines starting with # and
containing one word.

Man 0 contains a description of the manual as a whole.

Man 1 describes publicly-accessible commands, and has sub-sections:

  (1)  Commands of general utility.  
  (1C) Commands for communication with other systems.
  (1G) Commands for graphics and CAD.
  (1M) Commands for maintenance and administration.

Man 2 describes Minix system calls and error numbers.

Man 3 describes functions in various libraries, and has sub-sections:

  (3C) Functions that form the Standard C Library libc, which also includes
       the functions of (3S) and Section 2. 
  (3M) Functions forming the Math Library, searched with the -lm option.
  (3S) Functions forming the stdio package, included in libc.
  (3X) Various specialised libraries.

Man 4 describes the format of various files.

Man 5 describes miscellaneous facilities such as macro packages.

Man 6 describes games.

Man 7 describes special files.

     The following man files are available for PC Minix 1.5.0:

 Flags:        (none)
 Examples:     banner happy birthday   # Print a banner saying happy birthday

      Banner prints its arguments on standard output using a matrix of 6 x 6 
 pixels per character.  The @ sign is used for the pixels.
