File:   mtab - mount table

     /etc/mtab is an ASCII file which contains a list of currently-mounted
devices and their mount points.  It is started in /etc/rc, and maintained by
mount and umount.  It can be intialised by /bin/printroot, but this is not
essential. 

     A typical Minix /etc/mtab is:

 /dev/ram is root device
 /dev/hd4 is mounted on /usr
 /dev/hd2 is mounted on /tmp
