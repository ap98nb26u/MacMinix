File:    rc - run commands at logon

     /etc/rc is a shell script which is run by init at startup to set
up the system.  Among other things, it can mount standard file systems,
clear out scratch directories, and initialise devices.

     A typical Minix /etc/rc is:

 # Initialise mtab
 /bin/printroot >/etc/mtab

 # Mount the filesystem(s)
 /bin/echo "Mounting file systems" 
 /etc/mount /dev/hd4 /usr
 /etc/mount /dev/hd2 /tmp

 # Initialise the clock
 /usr/bin/date `/usr/local/bin/rtc`

 # Initialise the first RS232 line to 2400 baud
 /bin/echo "Initialising tty1 to 2400 baud"
 /usr/bin/stty 2400 </dev/tty1

 # General clear-out
 /bin/echo "Clearing spool directories"
 /bin/rm -f /usr/spool/uucp/*
 /bin/rm -f /usr/spool/at/past/*

 # More initialisation 

 >/etc/utmp
 /bin/echo

 # Display sign-on and start update
 /usr/bin/cat /etc/message
 /etc/update  &
