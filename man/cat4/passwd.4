File:   passwd - user identity

     /etc/passwd is an ASCII file which contains a list of the system's users
and the passwords (if any) they must use for access.  There is one entry per
line, and each line has the format:

        login_name:passwd:GID:UID:user_name:directory:shell

     The field descriptions are:

        login_name     the name of the user on the system, maximum 9 chars.
        password       the (encrypted) user password.  If this field is
                            empty, no password is needed.
        GID            the numerical group ID for this user.
        UID            the numerical user ID.
        user_name      the (optional) comment field (often a full user name).
        directory      the user's $HOME directory.
        shell          the program to run at logon (if empty, use /bin/sh). 

     A typical Minix /etc/passwd is:

 root:dqWF|GXx4mAq0:0:0::/usr/zzz/root:
 daemon:*:1:1::/etc:
 bin:*:2:2::/bin:
 guest::8:3::/usr/zzz/guest:
 ast:4dn7KO7EG11Ay:8:3::/usr/zzz/ast:
