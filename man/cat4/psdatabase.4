     /etc/psdatabase is a non-ASCII file which contains the kernel addresses
used by the program ps.  It is the image of a structure used in ps:

 typedef struct {
	struct nlist ke_proc[2], ke_tasktab[2];
	struct nlist mm_mproc[2];
	struct nlist fs_fproc[2];
 } sysinfo_t;

It is generated by the ps -U option.
