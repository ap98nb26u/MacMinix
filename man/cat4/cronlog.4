File:   cronlog - cron action log

     /usr/adm/cronlog is an ASCII file in which cron records each occasion
on which it executes a command from /usr/lib/crontab.  There is one entry
per line, and each entry has the format:

     execution_time    crontab_entry

     A typical Minix /usr/lib/cronlog is:

 07/26-13:33     /usr/bin/date >/dev/tty0   # Print date every minute
 07/26-13:34     /usr/bin/date >/dev/tty0   # Print date every minute
