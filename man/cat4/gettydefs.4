File:   gettydefs - speed and terminal settings used by getty

     /etc/gettydefs is an ASCII file which contains information used by getty
to set line parameters on login.  Each entry is followed by a blank line,
and has the format:

        label# initial_flags# final_flags# login_prompt #next_label

     The field descriptions are:

        label           string which getty tries to match with its argument.
        initial_flags   ioctl settings until getty executes login.
        final_flags     ioctl settings when getty executes login.
        login_prompt    used as the login prompt.  Note that unlike the
                             other fields, white space is significant.
        next_label      if the user types <Break>, getty will search for this
                             label and use its settings.
