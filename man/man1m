MINIX 1.5.0 Programmer's Manual, man(1m) version 1.1.

# INTRO

     Section 1m of the Minix Programmer's Manual should describe those
commands used for system administration.  In practice, such commands are
already covered in Section 1, and Section 1m is used for local additions.

# ncheck
Command:        ncheck - i-node to name converter
Syntax:         ncheck [a] [-i #,#] [s] file_system
Flags:           -a       List all files, even . and ..
                 -i #[,#] List only the inodes whose numbers follow
                 -s       List only special and setuid files
Examples: ncheck -i 10,15 /dev/fd0        # List i-nodes 10 & 15 on /dev/fd0

     Sometimes one knows about an i-node number and wants to find the file
name that goes with it; this program makes that mapping.  The default is to
list everything on the device, but the -i flag restricts the list to specified
i-nodes and the -s flag restricts it to special files and setuid files (to
look for possible security violations).
# format
Command:        format - format a floppy disk
Syntax:         format [-q][-a][special [kbsize]][-v [dosvollabel]]
Flags:          #       Format to size # KB
		/dev    Format device name /dev
                -q      Skip the "are you sure" prompt
                -v[LB]  Volume label LB and MSDOS structures added
                -a      sort interactive list alphabetically rather than by size.

Examples: format /dev/at0                 # Format disk in /dev/at0
          format /dev/at0 360             # Format disk to size 360KB
          format /dev/dosA                # Format for MSDOS
          format /dev/fd1 -v DOS_DISK     # Format and label MSDOS disk
          format                          # Interactive mode formatting

     Format allows the super user to format floppy disks.  If format is suid
then anyone logged into the console can format disks.  Format understands all
the eight disk/media combinations supported by PC-Minix.

Drive type numbers:

0   360K    360K      9       40     300 RPM  250 kbps   Standard PC DSDD
1   1.2M    1.2M     15       80     360 RPM  500 kbps   AT disk in AT drive
2   720K    360K      9       40     300 RPM  250 kbps   Quad density PC
3   720K    720K      9       80     300 RPM  250 kbps   Toshiba, et al.
4   1.2M    360K      9       40     360 RPM  300 kbps   PC disk in AT drive
5   1.2M    720K      9       80     360 RPM  300 kbps   Toshiba in AT drive
6   1.44M   1.44M    18       80     300 RPM  500 kbps   PS/2, et al.
7   1.44M   720K      9       80     300 RPM  250 kbps   PS/2, et al.

Minor device numbers for automatic drive typing:

Minor device: 0-3   4-7   8-11 12-15 12-15 16-19 16-19 20-23 24-27 28-31
Drive type:    0     1     2     3     3     4     4     5     6     7
Drive size:  auto  360K  1.2M  720K 1.44M  720K 1.44M  1.2M  1.2M 1.44M
Media size:  auto  360K  1.2M  360K  360K  720K  720K  360K  720K 1.44M

     Format expects special devices to have sizes; for minor devices 0-3
(automatic) it will try to format to the device's size, if there is one.  If
a size is specified on the command line, then it must agree with the actual
size of the special device.

     When given an MSDOS device name, or the -v option, format will add the
standard (non-bootable) MSDOS filesystem structures.

     If no special device is specified in the command line, format starts
up in interactive mode.  This allows a device to be formatted even if it
has a size of zero.

     Note that formatting a disk in a drive of different capacity, or with
unsuitable media, may give unreliable results.

     This program is used in the Intel versions of Minix only.
