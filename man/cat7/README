chap9.man.txt
asw 31.01.96

Kees got the OK from Andy to post the Minix 1.5 Reference Manual
Extended Manual Pages chapter (referred to frequently in the section 
0 man pages as Chapter 9, although actually Chapter 10 in later
versions, after the release of Minix for the Sun SPARC). 

I decided it would be nice to have the chapter 9 material accessible on
line, so I edited the file into a collection of cat-style man pages. I
think the right place for this is section 7. I put them in
/usr/local/man/cat7. Here it is as a shar file, chap9.man.shar.

I have suggested to Kees that these pages be included with 1.7.2 or
later releases, I don't know if he will do that.  Many sections need
at least a little revising, some are obsolete, and there is one (mdb)
which is for 68000 platforms only.

I didn't try to update, although here and there I made a comment. I did
reformat it so it's readable on an 80 column screen, and in the process I
found and corrected a surprising number of little errors that are for the
most part also in the printed manual that came out with 1.5.  (P-H didn't
put their best editors to work on this one, I guess).
